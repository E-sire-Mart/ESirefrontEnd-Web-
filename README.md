# Bazaar (just like Blinkit)

Bazaar is a cloned version of BlinkIt (formerly Grofers) which is an online supermarket application to buy Fruits, Veggies, Snacks, Milk & more and get delivery safely & hygienically to your home.

### Features
One can browse through various items, see their details, see similar products, add items to cart, view or edit them.

[Check live demo](https://blinkit-clone.surge.sh)

### Tools and Technologies
The application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with sole purpose of practising the basics and implementation of [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), while building something beautiful to showcase. 

This has the homepage and the product details page recreated using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
